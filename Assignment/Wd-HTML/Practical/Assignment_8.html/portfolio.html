    <h4>My Hobbies</h4>
    <h4>1. Photography</h4>
    <p>
      Photography involves capturing moments, landscapes, or portraits using a
      camera. It is a creative hobby that allows individuals to express
      themselves through visual storytelling. Whether using a professional
      camera or a smartphone, photography encourages exploration and observation
      of the world around you. It also enhances skills such as composition,
      lighting, and editing. Many people enjoy photography because it helps
      preserve memories while offering a satisfying blend of technical precision
      and artistic expression.

      Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants, flowers,
      vegetables, and herbs. This hobby can take place in a variety of settings,
      from small apartment balconies to large backyard gardens. Gardening is not
